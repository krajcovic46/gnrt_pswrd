# True random numbers password generator

A short python script that connects to RANDOM.ORG API and gets true random numbers which are then
used to pick a set of words to create a new password.

`words.txt` file is from: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words

If you've changed the `words.txt` file, use `update_max()` from `hlpr_scrpts.py`.

First password created by this script:
